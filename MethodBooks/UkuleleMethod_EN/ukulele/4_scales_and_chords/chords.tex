\section{Chords}

\subsection{Building chords}
In the previous sections we have learned about the major and minor scales. This information can be used to finally start to learn about chords.

\textbf{A major or minor chord is constructed by playing the 1st, 3rd and 5th note of a scale at the same time. That's it.}

\subsection{Open and barre chords}

When a chords is played that contains open strings, it is called an "open chord". When a chord is played without open strings, it is called a "barre chord".

The nice thing about barre chords is that you can move them up and down the neck. At that point the barre chord becomes more of a shape than a chord per se. Depending on what the root note is at a certain position, the barre chord will get a different name. We will see this later in the \textbf{CAGFD system}.

On the next page in \autoref{fig:ukulele_major_minor_chords} you will see all the major and minor chords listed. The chord \textbf{C} is a major chord and the chord \textbf{Cm} is a minor chords. The same holds for the other chords. Below each chords there are the 1st, 3rd and 5th notes from the respective scale (see \autoref{tab:ukulele_natural_note_major_scale} and \autoref{tab:ukulele_natural_note_minor_scale}).

The green dots indicate the root note. This is the note with the same name as the chord.

A couple things to note:

\begin{itemize}
	\item All chords, except the B and Bm chords, can be played as an open chord.
	\item The root and the 5th note of a scale are same for both the major and minor variant.
	\item The 3rd note of minor chord is always a half step / 1 semitone lower than it is in the major chord.
\end{itemize}

In most places on the internet you will see the E (and Em) chord be played as the barre variant. But you see here that it can also be played as an open variant.

The barre variant of the E chord is a good example of what was mentioned in the beginning. The thing about barre chords to become more like a shape that can become different chords. Compare the shape of the D and Dm chords with the E and Em chord shapes. Note how the shape is the same and there are no open strings in the E and Em. By just moving the D chord shape a whole step (two frets) to the right, the root note has changed and it is therefore now an E chord.

Lets play some chords. The theme song (\autoref{fig:ukulele_adventure_time}) of the Adventure Time series is a good start. The notes on the staff here are replaced by rhythm notation. The duration of the note shapes is still the same. But now it only indicates the strumming rhythm.

In the song "Knockin' On Heaven's Door" By Bob Dylan, the same chords are used as in the Adventure Time theme, plus one extra chord. The \textbf{Am}.

\begin{song}[verse/numbered, remember-chords, align-chords=l]{title={Knockin' On Heaven's Door - Bob Dylan}, music={Bob Dylan}}
	\begin{intro}	
		^{G}   ^{D}      ^{Am}     ^{G}Oo ^{D}oo-oo ^{C}oo \\
		^{G}Oo ^{D}oo-oo ^{Am}oo   ^{G}Oo ^{D}oo-oo ^{C}oo \\
	\end{intro}
	\begin{verse}
		^{G}Mama, take this ^{D}badge off of me ^{Am} \\
		^{G}I can’t ^{D}use it anymore ^{C} \\
		^{G}It’s gettin’ ^{D}dark, too dark for me to see ^{Am} \\
		^{G}I feel like I’m ^{D}knockin’ on heaven’s door ^{C} \\
	\end{verse}
	\begin{chorus}
		^{G}Knock, knock, ^{D}knockin’ on heaven’s ^{Am}door \\
		^{G}Knock, knock, ^{D}knockin’ on heaven’s ^{C}door \\
		^{G}Knock, knock, ^{D}knockin’ on heaven’s ^{Am}door \\
		^{G}Knock, knock, ^{D}knockin’ on heaven’s ^{C}door \\
	\end{chorus}
	\begin{verse}
		^Mama, put my ^guns in the ground ^ {} \\
		^I can’t ^shoot them anymore ^ {} \\
		^That long black ^cloud is comin’ down ^ {} \\
		^I feel like I’m ^knockin’ on heaven’s door ^ {} \\
	\end{verse}
	\begin{chorus}
		^Knock, knock, ^knockin’ on heaven’s ^door \\
		^Knock, knock, ^knockin’ on heaven’s ^door \\
		^Knock, knock, ^knockin’ on heaven’s ^door \\
		^Knock, knock, ^knockin’ on heaven’s ^door \\
	\end{chorus}
\end{song}

Another song to practice chord changes with with can be "Hey Ya!" from Outkast. This only uses four chords, and the order of the chords is the same throughout the whole song.

To give a feeling for the chords, the first part of the song is shown here. You can listen to the song and play these chords for the rest of the song.

\begin{song}[verse/numbered, align-chords=l]{title={Hey Ya! - Outkast}, music={Outkast}}
	\begin{intro}
		One, two, three, uh!
	\end{intro}
	\begin{verse}
		^{G}My baby don't ^{C}mess around \\
		Because she loves me so, and this ^{D}I know for ^{E}sure (Uh) \\
		^{G}But does she ^{C}really wanna \\
		But can't stand to see me walk ^{D}out the ^{E}door? (Ah) \\
	\end{verse}
\end{song}

So far you have played the songs using the 'standard' shapes. However, not all songs can or should be played with those chords. Instead you will want to learn about the barre shapes. Two examples are shown in \autoref{fig:ukulele_major_minor_chords} as the E and B chords. For these chords you place your index finger over (all) the strings, and use the remaining fingers to press the remaining notes of the chord. \autoref{fig:ukulele_barre_hand_shape} shows how the B major chord can be played with a barre shape.

The song "Perfect" by Ed Sheeran is a good song to practice the barre chords.

The song uses 4 chords: A$\flat$, Fm, D$\flat$, and E$\flat$.

Only the first verse is shown here to focus on the barre chords themselves. The barre chords to use are shown in \autoref{fig:ukulele_barre_chords_perfect_ed_sheeran}. Note the numbers below the shapes. These are the fret numbers.


\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../../Images/UkuleleChordsUsedInPerfectEdSheeran.png}
	\caption{Barre chords used in "Perfect - Ed Sheeran"}
	\label{fig:ukulele_barre_chords_perfect_ed_sheeran}
\end{figure}

The chords shown in \autoref{fig:ukulele_barre_chords_perfect_ed_sheeran} are not displayed in \autoref{fig:ukulele_major_minor_chords} directly (except for the Fm). 

Look at the A$\flat$ chord. The A chord is shown as an open chord in \autoref{fig:ukulele_major_minor_chords} instead of a barre chord. Making it difficult to move it one fret down to make it an A$\flat$.You may remember that A$\flat$ is the same as G$\sharp$. The G chord was shown as an open chord as well. But moving it up by one fret (to make it a G$\sharp$) only requires one extra finger on the first fret of the 4th string. This shape is shown in the A$\flat$ chord in \autoref{fig:ukulele_barre_chords_perfect_ed_sheeran}.

The same relation can be made between the D$\flat$ and the C$\sharp$, and between the E$\flat$ and the D$\sharp$.

Using this relation of the $\sharp$ and $\flat$, and knowing your basic chord shapes, allows you to play basically any chord.

\begin{song}[verse/numbered, align-chords=l]{title={Perfect - Ed Sheeran}, music={Ed Sheeran}}
	\begin{verse}
		I found a ^{Ab}love for ^{Fm}me \\
		Oh, darling, just ^{Db}dive right in and follow my ^{Eb}lead \\
		Well, I found a ^{Ab}girl, beauti^{Fm}ful and sweet \\
		Oh, I never ^{Db}knew you were the someone waitin' for^{Eb}me \\
	\end{verse}
\end{song}

\subsection{Your turn}

We've played all kind of different chords now. It's up to you to see which song you want to play, look up the chords on the internet, and practice the chord transitions. Feel free to play the chords in different ways. Each option gives a different sound, or maybe one option is easier to play than another. Just experiment!
