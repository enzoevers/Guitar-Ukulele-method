\infobox{This method assumes a right-handed player. If you are left-handed, replace “right” with “left” and vice versa.}

\textbf{First of all, there is no single correct way playing the guitar. Depending on what you find most comfortable, or the style that you play, you may use a different position. Or you simply mix multiple positions when you play different things.}

However, for more technical/quicker playing, you will probably be more comfortable and precise when you are sitting the classical way. The classical way of sitting also translates better to a standing position (see \autoref{fig:positin_standing}).

In the classical position you place the guitar on your left leg and the left leg will be slightly raised. You can use a foot stool for this (see the left foot in \autoref{fig:positin_sitting}).
