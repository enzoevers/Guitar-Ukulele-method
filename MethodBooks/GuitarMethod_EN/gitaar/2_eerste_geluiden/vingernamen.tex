\section{Finger names}

When playing guitar, your fingers will be given a name. This makes it easier in music notation to indicate which finger should be used. The names are shown in \autoref{fig:finger_names}.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{Names of the fingers \cite{FingerNames}}
    \label{fig:finger_names}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:left_hand_position} shows how to position your left hand. The most important thing is to have your fingertips almost completely perpendicular on the string. This makes sure that you get a clean sound and don't accidentally touch other strings.

\section{Free and rest stroke}

With a free stroke you hold your right hand in a relaxed position over the strings (see \autoref{fig:free_stoke_hand_position}). To play a string, move your finger through the string without lifting the upper part of your finger. Your finger should slightly curl into your hand. Once you made the sound, move your finger back to the relaxed position.

The trick now is, to not hit the other strings, and to not 'pluck' the string (making a buzzing sound).

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../../Images/Bradford-right-hand-close-2016.jpg}

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Free stroke position \cite{FreeStrokePositionBradlyWerner}}
  \label{fig:free_stoke_hand_position}
\end{figure}

A rest stroke may sound a bit louder (but with some practicing a free stroke can be as loud). Like the name suggests, a rest stroke means that you move your finger through a string to play it, but now you let your finger rest on the next string.

\section{Using a pick}

Besides fingers, you can also play guitar with a pick (also called a plectrum). For classical music you won't use a pick much, if at all. But when you are playing songs with chords, or playing some rock or metal riffs, you will be using a pick almost all the time.

While there is no single correct way to hold a pick, \autoref{fig:how_to_hold_a_pick} is a good starting point. The most important thing is that you don't grip too loose or too strong on the pick. Also, try to not bend you thumb inwards, but a either keep it straight of a little bit bend outwards.

\section{Exercises}

In the exercises below you see some symbols above the notes. The numbers with circles around them indicate on which string the note should be played (this can also be seen from the TAB). The \textit{i} and \textit{m} indicate which right-hand finger should be used to play the note.

Play exercise \autoref{fig:exercise_rest_free_stroke} first with a rest stroke and then with a free stroke to feel the difference. You can also try to play it with a pick afterwards.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \label{fig:exercise_rest_free_stroke}
\end{figure}

This second exercise (\autoref{fig:exercise_i_m_string_change}) is similar to \autoref{fig:exercise_rest_free_stroke}, but a bit more challenging.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../../MuseScore/Guitar/TwoStringAlternating.png}
    \caption{Exercise: changing strings with \textit{i} and \textit{m} fingers}
    \label{fig:exercise_i_m_string_change}
\end{figure}

To make use of all PIMA fingers, try to play the intro of \textit{Nothing Else Matters} from \textit{Metallica}. Play \autoref{fig:exercise_nothing_else_matters_metallica_intro_pima} with a free stroke. Also this you can try to play with a pick.

    \label{fig:exercise_nothing_else_matters_metallica_intro_pima}
\end{figure}

\newpage

In \autoref{fig:guitar_finger_exercise_perfect_ed_sheeran} you will also use your left hand. The numbers above the notes indicate which left-hand finger should be used to press the fret. Play this exercise using alternating \textit{i} and \textit{m} fingers.

Focus on the tabs for now and ignore the other symbols.
