\section{Why learn scales}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Improvising
	\item Chords are build on scales
	\item Chord progressions are based on scales
	\item Making interesting melodies
	\item Learn songs by ear easier
	\item And more...
\end{itemize}

Learning scales may sound boring. And, if you learn it without context, it indeed may be boring. However, scales are the foundation of music.

When a house doesn't have a good foundation, it can easily be destroyed by natural phenomena. But having a good foundation for the main house doesn't stop you from making a beautiful fairy-like garden or a nice painting all over the walls of the house.

The same goes for music. Scales will give you a framework to work with. A set of notes that sound good together. But you can, and should, be creative with how you use this framework. Using notes outside the scale can give some interesting sounds as well when used properly.

Some benefits for example are that you will be able to more easily figure out music by ear and that you will be able to improvise more easily over songs. 

\section{Creating context: playing your first chords}

If you can't wait to play some chords, feel free to have a look at \autoref{fig:guitar_major_minor_chords} right away to learn the basic chord shapes. If you search for songs on the internet with \textit{"<song name> <artist> chords"} you will most likely find a webpage with the chords to play.

Just learning these chord shapes will get you quite far in terms of being able to play along with songs.

But wouldn't it be nice to be able to figure songs out by ear as well, making chords sound more interesting, being able to improvise over a song, and making your own chord progressions? If so, continue with the next sections.

\section{Scales and intervals}

A scale is a collection of notes in ascending order between a note and its octave. The two main scales are the major (happy/bright sound) and minor (sad/dark sound) scale.

When describing scales, often the terms "whole" (w) and "half" (h) steps are used. Sometimes you will also see the terms "tone" (T) and "semitone" (S) respectively. Moving up a half step on the guitar means moving to the next fret (towards the body). Moving up a whole step is the same as two half steps. Moving down a half step means moving down one fret (towards the head).

Lets look at the intervals of 1 semitone again (\autoref{tab:guitar_sharp_flat_intervals_chap_5}). Going one step to the left or to the right is a half step interval. To take a whole step, simply take two half steps.

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{NiceTabular}{*{12}{P{5mm}}}
		\large{A} & \large{A\sharp} & \large{B} & \large{C} & \large{C\sharp} & \large{D} & \large{D\sharp} & \large{E} & \large{F} & \large{F\sharp} & \large{G} & \large{G\sharp} \\ \\
		\large{A} & \large{B\flat} & \large{B} & \large{C} & \large{D\flat} & \large{D} & \large{E\flat} & \large{E} & \large{F} & \large{G\flat}& \large{G} & \large{A\flat}
	\end{NiceTabular}
	\caption{Sharp and flat intervals. Each step to the left or right is a half step.}
	\label{tab:guitar_sharp_flat_intervals_chap_5}
\end{table}

A list of intervals and their names is shown in \autoref{tab:guitar_intervals_in_octave}. You don't have to learn these by heart as of now. But we will refer to these later on when describing the scales.

\subsection{The major scale}

As mentioned. The most common scales are the major and minor scales. A lot of music theory is based on the major diatonic scale. A diatonic scale means that it has 7 different notes in the scale where each letter only occurs once. So the major diatonic scale is the first one we will learn.

Each scale has a formula. For the major diatonic scale the formula is shown in (\autoref{tab:guitar_major_scale_interval}). On the top you see the steps between each note (the formula itself). The numbers indicate the interval of the note in the scale. Note 1 and 8 are the same note. But the 8 is one octave higher than the 1.

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{NiceTabular}{*{16}{P{0.05mm}}}
		\Block{}{} & \Block{1-2}{\large{W}} & & \Block{1-2}{\large{W}} & & \Block{1-2}{\large{H}} & & \Block{1-2}{\large{W}} & & \Block{1-2}{\large{W}} & & \Block{1-2}{\large{W}} & & \Block{1-2}{\large{H}} & & \Block{}{} \\

	\end{NiceTabular}
	\caption{Major scale intervals}
	\label{tab:guitar_major_scale_interval}
\end{table}

Note that \autoref{tab:guitar_sharp_flat_intervals_chap_5} has 12 different notes/pitches. Now count the total amount of half steps that are shown in \autoref{tab:guitar_major_scale_interval} (a whole step is two half steps). Indeed, there are 12 half steps to go from the note at note 1 to the same note one octave higher (note 8).

For example, to create the C major scale we will start on the C and then simply follow the formula.

In \autoref{tab:guitar_natural_note_major_scale} you see the major scales of all the natural notes. You don't need to remember these by heart at the moment. You do need to learn the formula of the major scale by heart. There are three things to note:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Each scale only has unique letters}. Therefore the 4th note in the F major scale is a B$\flat$ and not an A$\sharp$.
	\item The 5th note in the scale is the start of the scale on the next row. Of course, this is because they are listed as such now. But it is the basis of the "circle of fifths" which we will learn more about later.
	\item Each scale below another in this list has one more $\sharp$ than the previous. And the notes that have a sharp in one scale, also have a sharp in the scales below it. Again, this has to do with the "circle of fifths".
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Example}

In \autoref{fig:guitar_major_scale_fretboard} different shapes are shown on how the major scale can be played. The numbers correspond to the interval in the scale. These shapes can be moved up and down the fretboard, as long as the distance between the frets stay the same. Shape \autoref{fig:guitar_major_scale_fretboard_single_string} can even be moved up and down the strings. By moving the shape, you will play a different major scale. The scale that you are playing is determined by the root note (the "1" note). In this example we are therefore playing the F$\sharp$ major scale. If you would move all notes up by 1 fret, you would be playing the G major scale.

The different colors in \autoref{fig:guitar_major_scale_fretboard_standard} indicate different octaves. This is the 'standard'/compact major scale shape. Note how the frets with "8/1" indicate the 8 of the previous octave, and the 1 of the next octave.

There are other "shapes" to play the major scale as well, but these shapes don't start on the root (1) note. We will come back to those later.

Learning these shapes by heart makes it easy to improvise over a song. But more important is to see how these shapes relate to the intervals of the major scale. The easiest shape for this is \autoref{fig:guitar_major_scale_fretboard_single_string}. With this shape you can easily recognize the major diatonic scale formula (w-w-h-w-w-w-h). All shapes have the same notes, just played on a different position on the fretboard and possibly in a different octave. The shapes shown below don't cover all possibilities yet.

The F$\sharp$ major scale has the following notes:

\begin{table}[h]

	\end{NiceTabular}
	\caption{F$\sharp$ major scale}
	\label{tab:guitar_f_sharp_major_scale}
\end{table}

\autoref{tab:guitar_f_sharp_major_scale} demonstrates an important point mentioned earlier. \textbf{A scale only has unique letters}. Note how the 7th scale degree is an E$\sharp$ instead of an F. Generally we wouldn't write E$\sharp$. But because the F$\sharp$ major scale already uses the letter F for F$\sharp$, we can't use F for just F. We have to use E$\sharp$ instead.

\autoref{fig:guitar_f_sharp_major_scale_score_multi_octave} shows the notes that correspond to \autoref{fig:guitar_major_scale_octaves_over_fretboard}.

The song "Tattoo" from "Loreen" uses the F$\sharp$ major scale. The main melody that you hear in the background is shown in \autoref{fig:guitar_tattoo_loreen_main_backing_melody}. Also note that the chords are all in the scale of F$\sharp$ major.

	\caption{Tattoo - Loreen main backing melody}

\end{figure}

If you now compare the notes that are used, shown in \autoref{fig:guitar_tattoo_loreen_main_backing_melody_fretboard_major_scale}, and the multi-octave major scale of F$\sharp$ shown in \autoref{fig:guitar_major_scale_octaves_over_fretboard}, you will see that it nicely matches up.

The main differences are that the 'blue' 4 is now played on the 9th fret of the D string, and that the 'green' 3 is now played on the 6th fret of the high E string. Try to verify for yourself that these are indeed the same notes.

Because the number in the frets show the degree of the major scale we see that this melody covers all notes from the F$\sharp$ major scale (over show octaves). Note how all numbers 1 till 8 are used.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Improvising}

Another way to learn the major scale on the guitar is by improvising over songs and/or chord progressions (we will learn more about this in \autoref{sec:chord_progression}). A chord progression is a set of chord that is repeated.

The following chord progression in the \textbf{key of C-major}. You can play the C-major scale over this to make a nice melody.


\begin{itemize}
	\item C - F - Am - G
\end{itemize}

This is a "\RomanNumeralCaps{1} - \RomanNumeralCaps{4} - \RomanNumeral{6} - \RomanNumeralCaps{5}" chord progression (see \autoref{sec:chord_progression} if you want to know what this means).

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:guitar_c_major_scales_from_5_6_string_fretboard} shows the C major scale starting from both the 5th and 6th string. Note that the boxes around the frets outline the same shape as \autoref{fig:guitar_major_scale_fretboard_standard} and \autoref{fig:guitar_major_scale_fretboard_standard_start_5th_string} but in a different key. Also note that the colors all show the same pitch of the note. Try to verify this for yourself.

\subsection{The minor scale}

The minor diatonic scale has the formula shown in \autoref{tab:guitar_minor_scale_interval}.

To create the A minor scale we will start on the A and then simply follow the formula.

Similar to example for the major scales of the natural notes, \autoref{tab:guitar_natural_note_minor_scale} shows the minor scales of the natural notes.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Each scale only has unique letters}. Therefore the 6th note in the D minor scale is a B$\flat$ and not an A$\sharp$.
	\item The 4th note in the scale is the start of the scale on the next row. Of course, this is because they are listed as such now. But it is the basis of the "circle of fourths" which we will learn more about later. Note that for the major scale this was the fifth note. Therefore the earlier mentioned "circle of fifth" applies to major scale, while the term "circle of fourths" applies to minor scale.
	\item Each scale below another in this list has one more $\flat$ than the previous. And the notes that have a flat in one scale, also have a flat in the scales below it. Again, this has to do with the "circle of fourths".
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Example}

Just as for the major scale, there are different patterns for the minor scale (\autoref{fig:guitar_minor_scale_fretboard}). The numbers correspond to the interval in the scale. The scale that you are playing is determined by the root note (the "1" note). In this example we are therefore playing the F$\sharp$ minor scale. If you would move all notes up by 1 fret, you would be playing the G minor scale.

The different colors in \autoref{fig:guitar_minor_scale_fretboard_standard} indicate different octaves. This is the 'standard'/compact minor scale shape. Note how the frets with "8/1" indicate the 8 of the previous octave, and the 1 of the next octave.

Learning these shapes by heart makes it easy to improvise over a song. But more important is to see how these shapes relate to the intervals of the minor scale. The easiest shape for this is \autoref{fig:guitar_minor_scale_fretboard_single_string}. With this shape you can easily recognize the minor diatonic scale formula (w-h-w-w-h-w-w). All shapes have the same notes, just played on a different position on the fretboard and possibly in a different octave. The shapes shown below don't cover all possibilities yet.

The F$\sharp$ minor scale has the following notes:

The song "The Final Countdown" from "Europe" is in F$\sharp$ minor. The intro is shown in \autoref{fig:guitar_the_final_countdown_europe_intro}.

Looking at the notes used, you see that it nicely overlaps with the F$\sharp$ minor scale shown in \autoref{fig:guitar_minor_scale_fretboard_standard}. Just as in the previous fretboard diagrams, the numbers in the circles indicate the degree in the, in this case minor, scale.

\subsubsection{Improvising}

Just as we did for the major scale, we will also improvise over a minor chord progression (we will learn more about chord progressions in \autoref{sec:chord_progression}).

The following chord progression in the \textbf{key of A-minor}. You can play the A-minor scale over this to make a nice melody.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Am - Em - G - Dm
\end{itemize}

This is a "\RomanNumeral{1} - \RomanNumeral{5} - \RomanNumeralCaps{7$\flat$} - \RomanNumeral{4}" chord progression (see \autoref{sec:chord_progression} if you want to know what this means).

\begin{figure}[h]

	\caption{A minor chord progression}
	\label{fig:a_minor_chord_progression}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:guitar_a_minor_scales_from_5_6_string_fretboard} shows the A minor scale starting from both the 5th and 6th string. Note that the boxes around the frets outline the same shape as \autoref{fig:guitar_minor_scale_fretboard_standard} and \autoref{fig:guitar_minor_scale_fretboard_standard_start_5th_string} but in a different key. Also note that the colors all show the same pitch of the note. Try to verify this for yourself.

YouTube is full of different chord progressions in different keys if you search for it.

\section{Internalizing the scale formulas}

The most important formula to remember is the one of the diatonic major scale. Most music theory is based on this scale. Secondly, memorize the minor scale formula. At the beginning a good way to do it is:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Write the diatonic major (w-w-h-w-w-w-h) and minor (w-h-w-w-h-w-w) scale formulas on paper, and then write the scale of each note (A to G) by going through the formula.
	\item Practice the compact shapes starting from both the 6th and 5th string over the whole neck. While doing this, think about the note names in the scale that you are playing.
\end{itemize}

It might take some time to really internalize this, and it may be boring, but it's worth it in the long run.

In \autoref{chap:empty_guitar_fretboard} there are empty guitar fretboards. You can use these to fill in note names of a certain scale on the guitar as an additional exercise.

\section{Using a metronome (synchronize the left and right hand)}

Playing scales up and down is also a good time to focus on hand synchronization. Set a metronome to a comfortable speed and just play the scales up and down. Make sure that you hit a new note exactly on each beat of the metronome. If you feel comfortable with the speed, increase the BPM a bit.

% I don't particularly like modes a lot.
